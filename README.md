# SmallVolumeMultiplexerPaper
Data used to create the journal article on performance, testing, and applications of small volume multiplexer. Folders are labeled according to the Section in which the data was included.

Sec.2.3.1 - CrossContaminationResults.xlsx is the results of the cross contamination testing for the MPS Sec. 2.3.1, testing contamination occurring within the cuvette occurring from previous sample volumes.

Sec.2.3.2 -SourceCont1.csv contains the results of the source contamination study, Sec. 2.3.2, testing contamination of separate sources of alternating concentrations.

Sec.3.1 - Bioreactor.NO3.Injection_ForPaper.csv contains the data from the MPS experiment injecting KNO3 over 76 h into the lab bioreactor, and includes the R code used to generate figures for this data.

Sec.3.2 - 3.29.2016Corrected.csv - 4.12.2016Corrected_3comp.csv contain data used to calculate NO3 removal kinetics in the lab bioreactor, and includes the R code used to calculate kinetics

Sec.4.2_4.3 - KineticsData.csv files include the NO3 concentrations in stream mesocosms used to calculate kinetics and evaluate zero, first and efficiency loss models, and includes the R code used to calculate coefficients for each of the models.
