# SmallVolumeMultiplexerPaper
Data used to create the journal article on performance, testing, and applications of small volume multiplexer

CrossContaminationResults.xlsx is the results of the cross contamination testing for the MPS Sec. 2.3.1, testing contamination occurring within the cuvette occurring from previous sample volumes.

SourceCont1.csv contains the results of the source contamination study, Sec. 2.3.2, testing contamination of separate sources of alternating concentrations.

Bioreactor.NO3.Injection_ForPaper.csv contains the data from the MPS experiment injecting KNO3 over 76 h into the lab bioreactor.

3.29.2016Corrected.csv - 4.12.2016Corrected_3comp.csv contain data used to calculate NO3 removal kinetics in the lab bioreactor.

KineticsData.csv files include the NO3 concentrations in stream mesocosms used to calculate kinetics and evaluate zero, first and efficiency loss models
